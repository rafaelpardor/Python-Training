# Black Hat Python

## Chapter 2 - The network: Basics

This chapter give some basics on networking with Python, using sockets module. Socket module exposes
all of the necessary pieces to quickly write TCP and UDP client and servers, use raw sockets, and so forth.

The network is and always be the sexiest arena for a hacker, an attacker can do almos anything
with network access, inject packets, sniff data, remotely exploit hosts, and more.

### TCP Client

In this [code](tcp_client-2.py), we are making some assumption

1. the first one is that our connection will always succed

2. the second is that the server is always expecting us to send data first, as opposed to servers
that expect to send data to you first and await your response.

3. the third assumption is that the server will always send ud data back in a timely fashion
